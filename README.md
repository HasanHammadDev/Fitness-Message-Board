# Fitness Fanatics

In the Fitness Fanatics project, I implemented key features including post creation, editing, deletion, and category filtering. The project emphasizes a responsive design and dark mode for an optimal user experience. On the front-end, I utilized React with React Router for dynamic routing, SCSS for styling, and a custom ThemeContext for theme management. The back-end was built using Node.js and Express, incorporating CORS for secure requests, Multer for file uploads, Google Cloud Storage for file management, Path for file operations, and Dotenv for managing environment variables.
